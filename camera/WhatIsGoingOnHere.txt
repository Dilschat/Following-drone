The IP of 2nd computer is 192.168.1.2, port 5000. It is hardcoded in the camera 
factory

You define the camera you use, it MUST implement the interface Camera. 
Camera_local and Camera_hero4 are the implementations examples.

Camera_factory helps to get the needed camera with needed connection and 
tracker. Make new function for getting the new camera, when the current does not
suit you.

The main class is Main. You should only change the name
of camera_factory function and launch it.
$ python Main.py
